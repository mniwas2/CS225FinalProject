# How does our project work?
This is the link to our repository: 

Into your terminal type in: git clone 

Our project essentially aims to have 2 main functions. We take in a given individual's coordinates to then find the nearest airport. We also find the shortest path between 2 airports based on only existing routes. We are building all of the airports from the OpenFlights dataset which we use to perform all of the functions on (Airport.cpp, Airport.h). Following that, we are building the flights which are also the edges between the two airports (Flight.cpp, Flight.h). We plan to identify all airports by their respective IATA tags as it provides a uniform manner for us to receive inputs.

# How to use our program?

1. First clone our github repo: gh repo clone mniwas2/CS225FinalProject

3. Run make exec
4. Run bin/exec
5. Get to demo our project and figure out the optimal flight routes between origin and final destination
