# How does our project work?
This is the link to our repository: 

Into your terminal type in: git clone 

Our project essentially aims to have 2 main functions. We take in a given individual's coordinates to then find the nearest airport. We also find the shortest path between 2 airports based on only existing routes. With that, we aim use a pre-created set of 15-20 popular sightseeing locations which we rank in a sorted manner based on proximity to the desination airport.
